# breakfree2D
compute 2D trajectory for square plate, sphere and infinite span plate

The main program is TraceXZ  It manage the input and output of the calculation.

The trajectory equations are defined in motion2d.  Different correlations are used to compute aerodynamic forces: sphere, infinite span plate (2D plate), square plate (3D plate).
